# Trainer Setup - Platform engineering for Federal with BackStage

Welcome to this Platform engineering for Federal Workshop. In order to comprehend real-world situations, you will be testing with Azure services in several labs. Don't worry; you will be walked through the entire procedure in this step-by-step lab.

You will receive guidance on how to do each step throughout this workshop. Before seeing the solutions listed under the provided resources and links, it is advised to look at the solutions placed under the '📚 Toggle solution' panel.

<div class="task" data-title="Task">

> You will find the instructions and expected configurations for each Lab step in these yellow **TASK** boxes.
> Inputs and parameters to select will be defined, all the rest can remain as default as it has no impact on the scenario.

</div>

## Pre-requisites

Before starting this lab, be sure to set your Azure environment :

- An Azure Subscription with the **Owner** role to create and manage the labs' resources and deploy the infrastructure as code
- Register the Azure providers on your Azure Subscription if not done yet: `Microsoft.DevCenter`, `Microsoft.KeyVault`, `Microsoft.ApiManagement`, `Microsoft.Web`, `Microsoft.App`.

To be able to do the lab content you will also need:

- Basic understanding of Azure resources.
- A Github account (Free, Team or Enterprise)
- Create a [fork][repo-fork] of the repository from the **main** branch to help you keep track of your potential changes


3 development options are available:
  - 🥇 **Preferred method** : Pre-configured GitHub Codespace 
  - 🥈 Local Devcontainer
  - 🥉 Local Dev Environment with all the prerequisites detailed below

<div class="tip" data-title="Tips">

> To focus on the main purpose of the lab, we encourage the usage of devcontainers/codespace as they abstract the dev environment configuration, and avoid potential local dependencies conflict.
> 
> You could decide to run everything without relying on a devcontainer : To do so, make sure you install all the prerequisites detailed below.

</div>

### 🥇 : Pre-configured GitHub Codespace

To use a Github Codespace, you will need :
- [A GitHub Account][github-account]

Github Codespace offers the ability to run a complete dev environment (Visual Studio Code, Extensions, Tools, Secure port forwarding etc.) on a dedicated virtual machine. 
The configuration for the environment is defined in the `.devcontainer` folder, making sure everyone gets to develop and practice on identical environments : No more conflict on dependencies or missing tools ! 

Every Github account (even the free ones) grants access to 120 vcpu hours per month, _**for free**_. A 2 vcpu dedicated environment is enough for the purpose of the lab, meaning you could run such environment for 60 hours a month at no cost!

To get your codespace ready for the labs, here are a few steps to execute : 
- Start by forking the repository. Click on `Fork` and get a new copy of the repository which is now yours and that you can edit at your will.
- After you forked the repo, click on `<> Code`, `Codespaces` tab and then click on the `+` button:

![codespace-new](./assets/lab0-prerequisites/codespace-new.png)

- You can also provision a beefier configuration by defining creation options and select the **Machine Type** you like: 

![codespace-configure](./assets/lab0-prerequisites/codespace-configure.png)

### 🥈 : Using a local Devcontainer

This repo comes with a Devcontainer configuration that will let you open a fully configured dev environment from your local Visual Studio Code, while still being completely isolated from the rest of your local machine configuration : No more dependency conflict.
Here are the required tools to do so : 

- [Git client][git-client] 
- [Docker Desktop][docker-desktop] running
- [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] installed

Start by cloning the Hands-on Lab Platform engineering for Federal repo you just forked on your local Machine and open the local folder in Visual Studio Code.
Once you have cloned the repository locally, make sure Docker Desktop is up and running and open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.  

You will be prompted to open the project in a Dev Container. Click on `Reopen in Container`. 

If you are not prompted by Visual Studio Code, you can open the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for `Reopen in Container` and select it: 

![devcontainer-reopen](./assets/lab0-prerequisites/devcontainer-reopen.png)

### 🥉 : Using your own local environment

The following tools and access will be necessary to run the lab in good conditions on a local environment :  

- [Git client][git-client] 
- [Visual Studio Code][vs-code] installed (you will use Dev Containers)
- [Azure CLI][az-cli-install] installed on your machine
- [Terraform][terraform-install] installed, this will be used for deploying the resources on Azure

Once you have set up your local environment, you can clone the Hands-on Lab Platform engineering for Federal repo you just forked on your machine, and open the local folder in Visual Studio Code and head to the next step. 

## 🔑 Sign in to Azure
